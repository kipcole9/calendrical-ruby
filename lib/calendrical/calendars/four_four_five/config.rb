# TODO Store the config in Redis if available.  We aim to support multiple configs and if
# the number is small then its all ok.  But if we have multiple threads and thousands of configs
# as we might in a multi-tenant environment then Thread.current isn't the place to keep it.
# Also one side affect is that we will cache config in each thread which is not ideal
# However this approach as implemented does ensure every account/tenant/config_key gets a consistent
# set of defaults
